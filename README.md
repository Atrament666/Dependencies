This directory contains Makefiles to build all Clementine's dependencies for
Windows and Mac OS X.

Instructions are on Clementine's wiki:

- [Windows](https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine/wiki/Compiling-from-Source-%28Windows%29)
- [Mac OS X](https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine/wiki/Compiling-from-Source-%28Mac-OS-X%29)

If you're using Linux you don't need this repository at all, just get the
dependencies from your distro's package manager and build as normal.  See
[Compiling from source](https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine/wiki/Compiling-from-Source).
